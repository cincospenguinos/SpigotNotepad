TODO: explain what this is

## TODO/Issues

- [x] `/note` craps out because it's invalid
- [x] Notes only use IDs now, not names
- [ ] `/note read <NAME>` to read the full text of a note
- [ ] A message for creating a note informing that it's valid
- [ ] Show messages to player about note command in italics to help player know it's from the plugin
- [ ] Only show the first maybe 10 characters of a note, along with its name with the `/list` command
- [ ] A proper intellisense for note command stuffs
    - [ ] `/note TAB_PRESS` should show add, list, delete
